                This project was a collaboration between NTUDAC (National Taiwan University Data Analytics Club) and WeMo, 
                Taiwan’s largest shared electric scooter company. Its primary objective was to help WeMo’s data and marketing teams identify key user segments 
                to optimize marketing efforts and increase engagement among their most valuable customers.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>WeMo is Taiwan’s largest shared electric scooter service, offering flexible, on-demand mobility for riders across major cities. 
                As the user base grew, WeMo began generating extensive rental and behavioral data each day from a wide variety of riders. However, without a clear understanding of these user groups, 
                it was challenging for the team to uncover meaningful insights, tailor marketing strategies, and prioritize high-value customer segments. This created a need for a more structured and data-driven approach to segmenting users and guiding future acquisition efforts.</p>

            <p>We aim to analyze the dataset of 150K+ users and rental records provided by WeMo to identify distinct customer segments using machine learning models, 
                understand user behavior and cluster personas, and develop data-driven strategies to acquire new users and enhance engagement among key customer groups.</p>

                        <strong>Key feature 1: K-Prototypes ML Algorithm</strong><br>
                        In this project, we analyzed over 150,000 user and rental records and applied various machine learning algorithms for user segmentation, 
                        including K-Means, K-Prototypes, and HDBSCAN. Ultimately, we chose K-Prototypes to segment users into six distinct clusters. 
                        This segmentation enabled us to design tailored strategies for each user type, laying the foundation for targeted marketing and customer acquisition efforts.

                        <strong>Key feature 2: RFM Model to Identify High-Value Users</strong><br>
                        Using the six clusters derived from K-Prototypes, we applied the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to identify high-value users within each group. 
                        The analysis revealed that commuting office workers (Cluster 0) and commuting college students (Cluster 1) contained the highest proportion of high-value users. 
                        Based on these insights, we developed six targeted marketing strategies to engage and retain these key user groups effectively.

                        <strong>Key feature 3: Survey-Driven Strategy Validation</strong><br>
                        To evaluate the potential impact of our marketing strategies, we designed and distributed a user survey assessing the effectiveness of six proposed initiatives on users’ willingness to ride WeMo scooters. 
                        The insights provided actionable recommendations for prioritizing marketing initiatives and optimizing user engagement.
