                This is a project I worked on at school, primarily aimed at using R to analyze Taipei real estate transaction data to identify key factors influencing housing prices.
                Our team performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and regression modeling to understand how property characteristics affect both unit price and total price.

            <h3>01</h3>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Housing prices in Taipei are influenced by a complex mix of physical, legal, and locational attributes, 
                making it difficult for buyers, sellers, and policymakers to evaluate property value objectively. 
                Public transaction data is often noisy, inconsistent, or incomplete, and without proper modeling, 
                it is challenging to identify which factors truly drive price variations. 
                This project aims to address the challenge of extracting meaningful insights from imperfect data to deliver a reliable and data-driven understanding of Taipei’s housing market.</p>

                        <strong>Key feature 1: Distribution Analysis & Transformation</strong><br>
                        Before building our models, we conducted thorough comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to inspect the distribution of each variable. 
                        By plotting histograms for continuous features, we observed substantial right skewness in several predictors. 
                        Based on these findings, we applied log transformations to stabilize variance and improve the suitability of these variables for regression modeling.

                        <strong>Key feature 2: Outlier & Influence Diagnostics</strong><br>
                        To ensure a robust and unbiased model, we systematically identified and removed outliers and influential observations to ensure a more reliable model. 
                        Using Cook’s Distance, studentized residuals, and leverage values, we flagged data points that exerted disproportionate influence on the model. 
                        The refined dataset was then used for subsequent analysis.

                        <strong>Key feature 3: Model Diagnostics & Validation</strong><br>
                        After building our regression models, we performed a comprehensive diagnostic check to evaluate their validity. We examined scatterplots of residuals, residual-versus-fitted plots, residual histograms, and Q-Q plots. 
                        These visual tools helped us assess linearity, homoscedasticity, and the normality of residuals, ensuring the robustness of our final model.
