                This project was undertaken during my work at Winmate Inc. in 2025. 
                I contributed to the development of an AI-powered chatbot aimed at enhancing cross-department knowledge retrieval. 
                Leveraging generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, 
                the solution was designed to help employees access critical company information efficiently and effectively.

            <h3>01</h3>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Winmate, a listed industrial computer company celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2025, 
                had accumulated decades of specialized industry knowledge across multiple departments. 
                With offices and subsidiaries in the US, Switzerland, Germany, and Canada, and a growing workforce, 
                onboarding new employees became increasingly challenging. 
                New hires needed to quickly understand company operations and access cross-department knowledge, 
                which required a more streamlined and accessible way to tap into the company’s collective expertise.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- -----Goal---------------------------------- -->
         <div class="goal">
            <h3>02</h3>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The project aimed to leverage AI to streamline knowledge sharing across departments, 
                enabling employees to independently solve problems through interactions with a large language model (LLM). 
                The objective was to ensure quick onboarding, facilitate efficient access to internal know-how, 
                and help Winmate preserve and transfer its 30 years of industry expertise as the company continued to scale globally.</p>

                        <strong>Key feature 1: Enhanced Query Accuracy with RAG</strong><br>
                        In our solution, we leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses. 
                        Ｗhen a user query is received, 
                        the system first retrieves relevant documents or data from our knowledge base, 
                        then a generative model synthesizes this information to produce a clear and contextually accurate answer. 
                        By leveraging RAG, we can integrate existing LLMs with our company's internal data, 
                        enabling the solution to handle specialized queries with higher precision and deliver insights tailored to our business context.

                        <strong>Key feature 2: OpenWebUI Integration</strong><br>
                        Our chatbot is built on OpenWebUI, an open-source platform for creating interactive web-based AI interfaces. 
                        OpenWebUI provides a user-friendly interface that supports real-time conversations, seamless query input, 
                        and clear answer presentation, making it easy for employees across departments to adopt the chatbot.

                        <strong>Key feature 3: Department-Specific Customization</strong><br>
                        Each department can have its own customized model and knowledge base, tailored to their specific workflows and terminology. 
                        This allows the chatbot to understand department-specific context, provide targeted recommendations, and improve internal communication. 
                        Whether it's HR, Sales, or R&D, every team gets a chatbot that truly understands their needs.
